# Instructions :
# The goal is to create a class that represents a simple circle.
# A Circle can be defined by either specifying the radius or the diameter.
# The user can query the circle for either its radius or diameter.

# Other abilities of a Circle instance:

# - Compute the circleâ€™s area
# - Print the circle and get something nice
# - Be able to add two circles together
# - Be able to compare two circles to see which is bigger
# - Be able to compare two circles and see if there are equal
# - Be able to put them in a list and sort them
