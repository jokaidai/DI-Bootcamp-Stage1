			<p>Childhood: I was born in France and came to Israel 16 years ago at the age of thirteen, i manage to gaduate High school despite the language gap, i didn't spoke Hebrew at the time.<br><br>
				Army: In 2011 I join the Army in the Nahal fighter brigade, my 3 years in the army taught me a great deal about courage resilience and discipline!<br>
				I eventually pass the commander bootcamp and became a commander myself, this was and remain until today a great personal pride.
				For two years i operated in commanding affectation until the grade of first sergent when i finished my service and was release from active duty.
				Being a commander for so long gave me a lot of experience in manadging people equipment and calendar, I also developed analizing skills, it was nessecary to asses te strengh and weaknesess of each soldier under my responsability and known wich one to asign to wich mission.<br><br>
				World Tour /First Job:After the army like many other freshly release from service i wanted to tke a year off to travel the world and live some fun adventures!<br>
				Altought that year was mostly about having fun i learned a lot of things from the countries i visited : China, Greece, USA, Mexico and other ... <br>
				After my fun year i took my first job as a security agent in the Sharon hotel in Herzilia, the flexible hours allowed me to study and my experience as a soldier made the job rather easy.
				I worked there for almost 7 years and continue to work during my student year, student by day security agent by night!! <br><br>
				University: After a few years of working to put some money aside and 2 try of the psyckometrics test i finally join the Netanya Academic college and started learning Computer Science.<br>
				It was not a good experience as it was field with theory learning and teach us very few practical things, thats why i quit after 3 years of theory learning i knew that eventualy this lack of experience will be fatal for a junior Developer so i quit and try to make some experience by myself.
				Thats when i joined the Developers Institute and finally got to code for real!!<br><br>
				Conclusion:Im a fun guy with a lot of skills i like to learn by doing and i never give up!! whatever is asked of me i alwas adapt, i am exited to start working on my chosen field.
